        <!--
        Ok so lets go over how I want this website to look like. I'm thinking it'll be a home page with a nav bar.
        The first page will be an about me with maybe a couple pictures of the boards and things. I want it to be simple with 
        maybe a little backstory and just a couple pictures. 

        The second page will be the actual portfolio and have all the pictures with maybe some descriptions of the sizes and the woods that
        were used in them.

        Last page will have a thanks for visting and the links and saying my emails and things too.
        -->

                    <p class="title">About Me</p>
                    <p class="aboutmedesc">Hey! This is Paul from PS Hardwoods. I am 25 and just starting out trying to make a little 
                        business out of my hobby. I have been working with Paul Hopkins to learn how to make these things and now I 
                        feel confident in my own ability to make some quality products. I have made things from ornaments, coasters, 
                        and cutting boards. For sure check out my portfolio with the link at the top. You can check out some of 
                        Paul Hopkin's work too in the other portfolio tab. One thing that I consider our pieces unique for is our 
                        handles for our boards. I like to add a 45 degree angle handle that makes it really easy to grab a hold of 
                        the board. Look at my portfolio to see what that looks like. Though I highly recommend trying them out as I 
                        think they are the most comfortable handles that I have ever used on boards. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutmedesc">I also added my github account to the links page so that anyone who's interested can 
                        check out all of the websites that I've made since I've made a few other sites and not just this one. 
                        I have used the odin project to learn how to make them and would suggest checking them out. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutmedesc">Thanks so much for checking out my website! I hope you take a good look around and have 
                        a wonderful day!
                    </p>
