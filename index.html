Ok so lets go over how I want this website to look like. I'm thinking it'll be a home page with a nav bar.
The first page will be an about me with maybe a couple pictures of the boards and things. I want it to be simple with 
maybe a little backstory and just a couple pictures. 

The second page will be the actual portfolio and have all the pictures with maybe some descriptions of the sizes and the woods that
were used in them.

Last page will have a thanks for visting and the links and saying my emails and things too.

            <p class="aboutmedesc">Hey! This is Paul from PS Hardwoods. I've spent some time over the last few years learning 
                from my mom's boyfriend who's name also happens to be named Paul. We mostly work on cuttingboards like you'll 
                see on the right. Though I've also made coasters and some christmas ornaments. When it comes to these things 
                I always try to make the designs myself and for the cutting boards I like to put a 45 degree angle cut for a handle. 
                I don't normally see it being done, but I find that it makes it really easy and simple to pick up the boards if 
                you have trouble with the normal handles.
