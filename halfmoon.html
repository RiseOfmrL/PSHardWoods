        <!--
        Ok so lets go over how I want this website to look like. I'm thinking it'll be a home page with a nav bar.
        The first page will be an about me with maybe a couple pictures of the boards and things. I want it to be simple with 
        maybe a little backstory and just a couple pictures. 

        The second page will be the actual portfolio and have all the pictures with maybe some descriptions of the sizes and the woods that
        were used in them.

        Last page will have a thanks for visting and the links and saying my emails and things too.
        -->

                                It's completely unique and we had to use a special clamp to keep it together for gluing.
                                It is made of purple heart, walnut, and maple woods.
