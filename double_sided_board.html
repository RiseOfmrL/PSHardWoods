        <!--
        Ok so lets go over how I want this website to look like. I'm thinking it'll be a home page with a nav bar.
        The first page will be an about me with maybe a couple pictures of the boards and things. I want it to be simple with 
        maybe a little backstory and just a couple pictures. 

        The second page will be the actual portfolio and have all the pictures with maybe some descriptions of the sizes and the woods that
        were used in them.

        Last page will have a thanks for visting and the links and saying my emails and things too.
        -->

                                woods that I haven't used before. I also tested out making a double-sided board. It surprisingly 
                                came out looking good. This side uses the same woods as the other except for the center 
                                and two of the stripes towards the outside. So, there is walnut woods, bloodwood, and tiger wood.
                                On this side we also created a juice groove.

                                Unlike the normal 45-degree angle that we use we did two 45-degree angles having them meet int he middle 
                                to make it so we'll be able to pick it up from either side easily.
