        <!--
        Ok so lets go over how I want this website to look like. I'm thinking it'll be a home page with a nav bar.
        The first page will be an about me with maybe a couple pictures of the boards and things. I want it to be simple with 
        maybe a little backstory and just a couple pictures. 

        The second page will be the actual portfolio and have all the pictures with maybe some descriptions of the sizes and the woods that
        were used in them.

        Last page will have a thanks for visting and the links and saying my emails and things too.
        -->

                    <p class="title">About Our Board Wax</p>
                    <p class="aboutmedesc">Hey this is Paul from PS Hardwoods and ths is our homemade board wax. We 
                        make our board wax with all food safe materials so you'll feel safe with using it on anything 
                        you feel like you would want to use it on. Feel free to use our wax on any wooden product 
                        that you're using in contact with food. Like cuttingboards and things like wooden spoons or 
                        spatulas.
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutmedesc"> We make our wax out of mineral oil to bring out the grain of the boards 
                        or whatever you're choosing to use it on. We also use a mixture of waxes made up of beeswax 
                        and carnauba wax to lock in the mineral oil to make it so it lasts for many uses.
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutmedesc">Using the wax is very simple. You start off rubbing some on with either 
                        a towel or your hands. Then you wait for at least 10-15 minutes but you can wait as long 
                        as an hour if you really want to have it be set in. Then wipe off the excess before use and 
                        then you're all set. Your curtting board should be all revitalized and ready fur use.
                    </p>
